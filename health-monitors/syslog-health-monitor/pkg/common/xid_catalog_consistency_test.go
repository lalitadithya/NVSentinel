// are two halves of one contract, and nothing currently holds them together. The

// bucket string that the sheet never contained. Both failure modes are silent: an
// unmatched bucket falls through to CONTACT_SUPPORT, which looks like a severe fault
// rather than like a missing mapping.
//
// These two tests close it in both directions. The allowlists are the point as much as
// the assertions: they record in the source which buckets are deliberately human-triage
// and which cases are deliberately staged ahead of the catalogue, so that "no handler"
// and "intended for a human" stop being indistinguishable from the outside. See
