# NPD custom plugin: nvidia-fabricmanager unit presence.
#
# Install this rule only on fleets where the operator declares Fabric Manager
# required AND host-systemd-managed (NVSwitch platforms with the host unit):
# it reports unhealthy when the unit is absent (LoadState=not-found),
# distinguishing misconfiguration from "disabled on purpose". Fleets running
# FM inside the GPU Operator driver container must omit this rule — no host
# unit exists there even though FM is running.
#
# Exit codes follow the NPD custom-plugin protocol:
#   0 = healthy, 1 = unhealthy, 3 = unknown.
# Probe failures never clear a fault: the script holds its last confirmed
# state (unhealthy indefinitely; healthy for PROBE_FAIL_MAX consecutive
# failures, after which the stale confirmation is degraded and the check
# reports unknown). A failed state-file commit never clears a fault either:
# an unhealthy result is still reported unhealthy; other results report
# unknown.
