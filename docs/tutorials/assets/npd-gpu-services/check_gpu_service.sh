# NPD custom plugin: GPU-support service liveness, parameterized.
#
# One NPD permanent rule per configured service, each bound to its own
# condition type. The reference Fabric Manager liveness rule invokes this
# script too:
#
#   { "type": "permanent", "condition": "FabricManagerDown", ...
#     "path": "/etc/npd-plugins/check_gpu_service.sh",
#     "args": ["nvidia-fabricmanager"] }
#
# Exit codes follow the NPD custom-plugin protocol:
#   0 = healthy, 1 = unhealthy, 3 = unknown.
# Stdout becomes the condition message on state transitions.
#
# Contract (NVSentinel GPU system-service check contracts):
# - LoadState=not-found exits healthy: the liveness check skips absent
#   units; presence is a separate, operator-declared check
#   (check_fm_installed.sh).
# - ActiveState=active confirms healthy and resets the failure count.
# - Transitional states (activating/deactivating/reloading) neither confirm
#   health nor count as down: the script holds its last confirmed state and
#   resets the consecutive-failure count, so a service starting up or in a
#   planned restart never fires the condition.
# - A non-running observation (inactive/failed) reports down only after
#   FAIL_THRESHOLD consecutive probes; anything else resets the count.
# - Probe failures never clear a fault: the script holds the last confirmed
#   state (unhealthy indefinitely; healthy for PROBE_FAIL_MAX consecutive
#   failures, after which the healthy confirmation is considered stale and
#   the check reports unknown until a probe confirms either state).
# - A failed state-file commit never clears a fault either: an unhealthy
#   result is still reported unhealthy; other results report unknown, since
#   their debounce or hold accounting could not be persisted.
