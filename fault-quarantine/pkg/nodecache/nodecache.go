// Package nodecache decides what a cached node keeps, and prunes it to that.
//
// A node carries around a hundred labels and a dozen annotations, and the
// per-entry cost of holding them dominates what the informer cache costs at
// fleet scale. The Node rules read a handful of keys by name, and they are
// configuration read at startup, so the keys are knowable before the first
// object is cached.
//
// Pruning is only safe against the whole of what fault-quarantine reads, which
// is wider than what the rules read. It also removes keys, and a removal is a
// merge-patch diff against the cached object: a key the cache dropped cannot
// appear in the diff, so deleting it silently does nothing. Every key that can
// be removed therefore has to be retained as well.
